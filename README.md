-The Main Page features the following: 
  1. Visualizing the most popular products 
  2. A search bar for finding the wanted product by specifying its name
  3. A Category panel on the left side for filtering the products
  4. Visualizing Details of each product and adding it to your shopping cart
  5. Visualizing all the products from your shopping cart and setting the quantity before proceeding to checkout
  6. After placing an order, a random order number will be generated (this will be used in the Tracking Order)
  7. A "My Account" panel where the user can see all its account details (email, full name, phone number, username, password) 
  8. A Track Order panel where the user will be able to search its order by specifying the order number and also updating the "Order Status". When the user first places an order, the Status will be "Processing..." And after pressing the "Refresh Order Status" button the status will become "Delivered!"

This project was made using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. As the requirement was to run it only on a local server, some of the functionalities were minimal. The project is hosted locally through Mowes Portable.
